** Cuckoo README **

Cuckoo is an open source computation offloading project of the Computer
Systems group of the Computer Science department of the Faculty of
Sciences at the VU University, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.  The
main goal of the Cuckoo project is to simplify computation offloading
for Android apps.

Cuckoo is free software. See the file "LICENSE" for copying permissions.

The manual in the docs directory of the library project ("docs/manual.pdf") explains
how to build and run your Cuckoo application.

The current Cuckoo source repository tree is accessible through Github at
https://github.com/interdroid/cuckoo-library and https://github.com/interdroid/cuckoo-plugin
